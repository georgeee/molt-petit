# Certified light-client safety under key exposure

The certificate form of `exposure_agreement`: what a light client
actually holds is a recursive certificate claim plus a suffix of signed blocks.
Every history the certificate's grounding attests, extended by its suffix, agrees
with the other presentation's at every height that is at least `n` below both
tips. No block needs to be *exposed* in either suffix: the conclusion is about the
attested histories themselves.

The signature bridge `hbridge` is EUF-CMA plus causality: a signature the verifier
holds at real slot `R` was produced (logged) at some real slot no later than `R`.

THE STATEMENT OF `exposure_certified_agreement` IS FIXED. Its exact type is pinned by
`Molt/AxiomsExposureCert.lean`. Prove it; do not change it.
